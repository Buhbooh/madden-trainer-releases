# Madden Trainer for Madden 24 Build Notes

## Build 0.0.4 (RELEASE CANDIDATE)

Additions:
1. Added an administrative function that allows you to revert all attribute gains for the current YEAR. Note that this only works for the current year - once you advance to the next year in your franchise, you cannot revert the rating from previous years.

Changes:
1. Various cosemtic changes
2. Modified the way injuries impact ratings changes.  Injury impacts are now dependent on age, and rating hits are no longer guaranteed on sever injuries. This should lessen the impact of season-long injuries.

## Build 0.0.3 (RELEASE CANDIDATE)

Additions:
1. You can now click on a player in the trainer report and see their training history from prior weeks!

Bug Fixes:
1. Minor issues with scaling and sizing on training report.

## Build 0.0.2 (BETA)

Additions:
1. Added simple sorting support to important columns on Training Report.
2. Make sorted column sticky when selecting different team/iteration on both reports.
3. App Window is now resizable.

Changes:
1. Default app size is now closer to 16:9 ratio.
2. Rookies now show 'R' for Years Pro, instead of 0.

Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed issue where sorting was broken on some columns on Overall Report.
